    I joined BGI-Shenzhen as a Bioinformatician in the Bioinformatics platform, Mass Spectrometry department at BGI-Shenzhen. In BGI, I developed PDV (Proteomic Data Viewer), a standalone software written in Java. This lightweight visualization tool enables intuitive and fast exploration of diverse, large-scale proteomic datasets, including database search results, de novo sequencing results, proteogenomics files, MS/MS data in mzML/mzXML format, and data from public proteomics repositories. This resulted in a first-author paper in Bioinformatics, which has been cited over twenty times since its publication in 2019.
