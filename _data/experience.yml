    I am currently working at Baylor College of Medicine as a bioinformatics programmer mostly foucs on proteomics and proteogenomics data analysis and workflow development. In this two years, I am so glad to anticipate several Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) projects and did neoantigen analysis for them. During this process, I worked with my genius colleges to develop many great tools such as NeoFlow and DeepRescore.
